Adding here cause Ghassem said. 

PyCaret is a Python open-source machine learning library designed to make performing standard tasks in machine learning easy.  Throughout the implementation of our project PyCaret was used to compare, create, tune, and plot models. This paper works with the abalone dataset from the UCI machine learning repository and applies classification on it based on the 'Sex' target value.
